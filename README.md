# Watery Wordplay Wreck - My Milestone Project

Welcome to my third milestone project, Watery Wordplay Wreck.

Watery Wordplay Wreck is a word guessing game built with Python. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)" target="_blank">Hangman</a> game in the style of a sinking ship to represent the progress of the game.

The user is able to choose the number of lives per game to set the difficulty. By guessing either one letter at a time, or an entire word, the user attempts to guess the correct word before the ship sinks completely. Each failed attempt results in the user losing a life and causes the ship to sink deeper into the sea.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning and understanding of the Python modules that I have completed thus far and to implement them into a live project. This was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in design and development. The project is a functional terminal application, built from a template provided by <a href="https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template" target="_blank">Code Institute</a> combined with my Python code.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project and I truly hope you enjoy it as much as I did designing and developing it.

## UX - User Experience Design

### User Stories

As a first-time user:
  - I would like to understand how the game works and how to play with ease.
  - I would like to be able to adjust the difficulty to suit my level.
  - I would like instant feedback for each of my guesses while playing the game.
  - I would like to see any letters or words that I have already tried to avoid suggesting them again.
  - I would like to see an error message if my guess is invalid and I would like to be told why.
  - I would like to be able to monitor my progress during the game.
  - I would like to have the option to play the game again or finish my session when the game ends.

As a returning user:
  - I would like to be able to relearn the game quickly and easily.
  - I would like the challenge to remain and encounter different words than my last visit.

## Logic Flow
To plan the logic flow of the game, I created the chart below

## Deployment

#### Github

This project is deployed using GitHub pages using the following process,

#### Deploying a GitHub Repository via GitHub Pages

1. In your <em>Repository</em> section, select the <em>Repository</em> you wish to deploy.
2. In the top horizontal Menu, locate and click the <em>Settings</em> link.
3. Inside the <em>Setting</em> page, around halfway down locate the <em>GitHub Pages</em> Section.
4. Under <em>Source</em>, select the None tab and change it to <em>Main</em> and click <em>Save</em>.
5. Finally once the page resets scroll back down to the <em>GitHub Pages</em> Section to see the following message "Your site is ready to be published at (<em>Link to the GitHub Page Web Address</em>)". It can take time for the link to open your project initially, so please don't be worried if it down not load immediately.

#### Forking the Github Repository

You can fork a GitHub Repository to make a copy of the original repository to view or make changes without it affecting the original repository.

1. Find the GitHub repository.
2. At the top of the page to the right, under your account, click the <em>Fork</em> button.
3. You will now have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

#### Making a Local Clone

1. Find the GitHub Repository.
2. <em>Click</em> the Code button
3. <em>Copy</em> the link shown.
4. In <em>Gitpod</em>, change the directory to the location you would like the cloned directory to be located.
5. <em>Type</em> <code>git clone</code>, and <em>paste</em> the link you copied in step 3.
6. Press <em>Enter</em> to have the local clone created.
