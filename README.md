# Watery Wordplay Wreck - My Milestone Project

<img src="assets/images/responsive-test.jpg" alt="Image showing responsive test for my website" width="100%">

Welcome to my third milestone project, Watery Wordplay Wreck.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning and understanding of the Python modules that I have completed thus far and to implement them into a live project. This was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in design and development. The project is a functional terminal application, built from a template provided by <a href="https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template" target="_blank">Code Institute</a> combined with my Python code.

Below, I will outline each step of the process and my reasonings used to plan this project. I will reference my sources and highlight my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project and I truly hope you enjoy it as much as I did designing and developing it.

## UX - User Experience Design

The inspiration behind the planning of this project comes largely from my love of music and lifelong dream of establishing my own recording studio (purely for my hobbies and not for a career!). I am a musician myself and I've always been inspired by the great creatives of our generation. By thinking of the user experience through each step of this design journey, it has resulted in a more positive experience and general feel.

I have broken down the planning into the five planes:
- __The Strategy Plane__ 
- __The Scope Plane__
- __The Structure Plane__
- __The Skeleton Plane__
- __The Surface Plane__
  

## Strategy Plane

My aim as the creator of this project is to instil the inspiration that I feel towards music and companionship.

#### Creator Stories

Creator Goals
- I aim to ensure my project is easy to navigate.
- Due to my project being a mostly information-based site, I don't want my users to get lost in the text.
- As a creator, I strive to invoke positive emotional responses from users.
- My content should be relatable. Any images, text or quotes should have purpose.
- I don't want to overload my users with information so I need to invest time into establishing a structure that works well for my project. It should ease the user in.

Once I established my strategy, the most important consideration from the user's perspective was how a user would feel going through the project.

#### User Stories

First-time visitor goals:

- As a first-time visitor, I want instant clarity about the project's purpose upon landing on the page.
- I desire effortless navigation - the ability to return to the home page quickly and a seamless way to move forward without needing to scroll back through the content.
- I hope to find reinforcement and support for the content that I am consuming through quotes, stories or images.
- I aim to experience a sense of progression while navigating the page without feeling overwhelmed or lost.
- I want to enjoy a visually engaging experience without becoming fatigued.

Returning visitor goals

- As a revisiting user, I aim to establish contact with the creator or creators, either through social links or a dedicated contact page.
- I seek the ability to reference information sources or discover the origins of the provided content.

The user stories empower me to develop a clearer concept of the project's feature requirements and their relative priorities.

During my initial planning, I researched local studios in the area and reviewed their websites. Many of these websites overloaded their users with so much content, whereas others went in the other direction and had very minimal information about the studio and the services they provided. 

I asked my friends and fellow musicians, what elements of a music studio that they would be concerned with and their responses helped me to establish the core content for the website and where my focus should be.

## Scope Plane

Based on my strategy goals, I was able to establish that I wouldn't be able to implement everything that I had thought of and the suggestions of what users would like to see. It simply wasn't feasible for my initial release. 

The easiest solution for me to start was a minimum viable product, which would provide the core content that I had deduced from my research.

From this, I was able to split my project into three phases.

#### Phase 1 - 

- A home page with an introduction to the project, which I decided should also host the "About" content.
- A studios page where I could detail the space provided.
- A 'Meet The Team' page to introduce the team. This was an essential element as it was a consideration my fellow musicians regarded highly.
- A 'Contact Us' page, complete with a form to allow users to get in touch.

#### Phase 2 - 

- An expansion on both the 'Studios' and 'Meet The Team' pages, complete with additional images.
- Further refining of all of the styles throughout the website, allowing for consistency.

#### Phase 3 (Future Features) -
- Interactive Elements (to be implemented once I have knowledge of JavaScript)
- Light Mode/Dark Mode toggle 

Having a phased approach would allow me to release a functional website, containing all of the fundamental content that my users desire while allowing me to refine my design, better understand my flaws and collect feedback.

## Structure Plane

Recognising early in the project that it would be text-intensive, the main challenge was ensuring user engagement and preventing them from being overwhelmed. I sought inspiration through a long list of familiar websites, shortlisting any text-intensive websites that felt good and didn't overwhelm. From this list, I reviewed their structure and came up with my own layout to recreate that feeling.

The colour palette for my project was based on an Earthly, Coastal, Modern concept. I wanted the website to feel clean and cut like modern pages, consisting of monochrome elements, while retaining Earthy tones to represent the historical and landscape elements to the studio. The Earthy and Coastal theme was inherited by my home, North Wales. This is also the influence behind the name, Salt And Stone. I live on the coast, yet I am surrounded by mountains. 

Initially, I had intended on having an image as the entire background, but I felt that a busy background combined with a text-intensive website would not make for an enjoyable experience. I decided to proceed with a white background with standard black text for the bulk of the content. This way, I could consciously include only images and features that would add to the website's appeal.

#### Typography:-

- Lora
- Tai Heritage Pro

I chose these fonts because they are subtle and cohesive. They allowed for just enough separation between headings and paragraphs that didn't draw your attention too much. Both fonts are very easy to read, making it accessible to most people.

#### Additional Considerations

- It was crucial that my navigation bar and footer remained consistent throughout the website. This provides familiarity and comfort to the user and promotes effective navigation on their part. I included a 'Back To The Top!' button in the footer so that users don't need to scroll back through the content to reach the navigation bar.

Incorporating social media links in the footer, complete with a subtle hover effect, allows users to interact without overwhelming colours.

Uniform imagery throughout the project helps to condense the text and also allows the user to take a breath and enjoy the view. All images are relatable and relevant to the content displayed on the page.

The text will be consistent on all pages in fonts and colors with subtle changes to layouts and positioning to prevent monotonous scrolling through similar looking content.

Responsive design across all devices guarantees proper image scaling and readability without pixelation, making content accessible to a wide range of users.

## Skeleton Plane

I found it beneficial to prepare written drafts of all my pages in advance. This approach allowed me to proofread and correct any grammatical errors while providing a structured foundation for my content. Writing the content in advance allowed me to carefully plan text placement, paragraph structure, and the use of subheadings.

I mocked up a few designs on MicrosoftWord, simply for the general layout and flow of the website and this allowed me to piece together the puzzle that was my final design.

## Surface Plane

In the features section below, you will see all of the features that I have implemented in their final form, thus forming the Surface Plane.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Logo__
  - The logo for my project is stamped in the top left corner of the header and is consistent through every page. This serves as a constant reminder of where the user is and promotes connection.

  <br>

  <img src="assets/images/logo-studios-readme.png" alt="Image showing logo of website on Studios page">
  <img src="assets/images/logo-team-readme.png" alt="Image showing logo of website on Team page">
  <img src="assets/images/logo-contact-readme.png" alt="Image showing logo of website on Contact page">

<br>

- __Navigation Bar__

The fully responsive navigation bar, featured consistently on all four pages, contains links to the Home, Studios, Team and Contact pages. Its consistency across all pages ensures seamless navigation, regardless of the user's device, eliminating the need to rely on the browser's 'back' button for page transitions. On mobile devices, the navigation bar is nested within a hamburger icon; once clicked, it reveals a dropdown menu, ultimately saving precious screen real estate on smaller devices.

  <img src="assets/images/services-readme.png" alt="Image showing the services provided"></a>

- __Experiences Image Grid__

  - This section displays three images and a video, all of which represent the studio in some sense. The first image is of Snowdonia, the area that the studio is based in. The video demonstrates a world-famous musician recording an album in the studio. The final two images are of famous musicians who have used the studios services in the past. This section will both entice and reassure users that this is an authentic website, providing high quality services.

  <br>

  <img src="assets/images/experience-grid-readme.png" alt="Image showing the experience grid section of the website">

<br>

- __The Footer__

- The footer contains a 'Back To The Top!' button, disguised as a simple up arrow icon. There are also four links to the most popular social media websites, along with the studio address and a small emblem representing the studios date of establishment. 
- The footer is consistant throughout the website, allowing users to become familiar with the navigation between pages. The social media features encourage user loyalty as they are able to connect deeper through social media links.

<br>

## Testing

### Further Testing

- The project was tested on the following browsers with success: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.
- The project was manually tested on an iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13 and iPad Pro 12.9 with success.
- Mozilla Firefox Developer tools were used throughout the project to help test the responsiveness across multiple device options.
- Mozilla Firefox Developer Tools used to emulate screen sizes below:
  - 360px x 640px (Standard Phone)
  - 810px x 1080px (iPad)
  - 1280px x 900px (Laptop)
  - 1440px x 900px (Desktop)

### Validator Testing

I used the  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validator</a> to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

- No errors were returned when passing through the official <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validator</a>.
- No errors were found when passing through the official <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validator</a>.

### Unfixed Bugs

- I discovered that my CSS didn't quite function well after 1440px and up. In the future, with more experience, I would want to ensure that the website is function no matter the size of the screen.

<br>

<img src="assets/images/hero-image-bug-readme.png" alt="Image demonstrating the footer, along with social media links and back to top button">

<br>

- On the Contact Form, due to having the email entry a required element, the CSS which forces the placeholder text up and out of the box during :focus and :valid doesn't function as planned if the user types anything but an email address. After numerous attempts, I decided that this would need to wait until I have more experience, before I am able to correct the CSS to function more effectively.
